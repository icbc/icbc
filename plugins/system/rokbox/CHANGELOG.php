# Fallback issue that had to be the IFrame.
# Bug in the captioning where the first time you opened RokBox it didn't fire correctly the caption causing it not showing up.
# Album names now support uppercase letters and number, not lowercase only.
# Issue in the Close button not hiding when closing rokbox.
# IE JS error in IE when closing RokBox with Explode or QuickSilver animations.
# Minor CSS issues in Themes that fix Explode animation.
# BackgroundColor parameter for Audio Objects was missing and causing display issues.
# Local URIs now works correctly and get loaded via IFrame instead of Ajax.
# More media formats support, the complete list is now:
	! Images: Links ending with .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .bmp
	! Generic Videos: Links ending with .mov, .qt, .mpeg, .divx, .avi, .xvid, .wmv, .wma, .wax, .wvx, .asx, .asf
	! Video Sharing Services: YouTube, DailyMotion, Metacafe, Google Video, Vimeo, Simple .swf files
	! Audio: Links ending with: .mp3, .wav
	! Local and Remote URIs
+ PDF Support
+ You can now avoid to specify sizes for: Generic Videos [320 x 240], Video Sharing Services (YouTube [425 x 344], DailyMotion [420 x 339], Metacafe [400 x 345], Google Video [400 x 325], Vimeo [400 x 225]), Audio [320 x 45] and images (LOCAL ONLY). The default sizes for those are built-in RokBox and would be used if you don't specify one. By setting your own size via "size=|width height|", you overwrite the built-in sizes.
